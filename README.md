# Covid19CoughDetection
 We figured that COVID-19 patients, including the asymptomatic can be identified using only cough recordings.
 We collected data of the cough recordings through various sources and the cough recordings are transformed with Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient and inputted into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

We obtained accuracy of about 98%.
